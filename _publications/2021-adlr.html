As of 2020, fixed wing UAVs already have a broad spectrum of applications: forest monitoring, building inspection,
archaeology or blood transfusion delivery. In most applications the high flying speed as well as high energy efficiency,
thus long flight duration is valued. For rapidly changing demands or when reacting to unforeseen disturbances (weather,
wind, thermals) current solutions still require either a trained human pilot, lots of training data or can only utilize
a reduced flight envelope. We therefore try to achieve a solution, trained in simulation, that shows a good sample
efficiency and generalizes better to unseen disturbances than current control approaches.
Using an off-policy meta reinforcement learning algorithm named PEARL, we aim to train an agent within the
pyfly-simulator in an own gym environment to control a fixed-wing UAV to follow a pre-defined trajectory, hoping to
achieve high robustness and better sample efficiency than standard SAC.
