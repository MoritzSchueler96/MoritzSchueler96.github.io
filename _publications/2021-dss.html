Social behavior modelling or social modelling is a quite old field of study
which evolved from the curiosity about what effects our actions. Traditional
behavioral theories claim that our actions are learned by reinforcement (re-
ward or punishment) for or by reproduction (doing the same things again
and again) of an action. Social modelling expands these theories in the
way that it not only focuses on reinforcements but also considers the internal
processes of an individual. Explicitly, it shows that learning can happen
solely by observation of a behavior and its consequences, also called vicarious
reinforcement
