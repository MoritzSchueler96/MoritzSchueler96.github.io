Adversarial training is a technique that tries to
achieve robust deep networks. Robustness in a
sense, that perturbing the input does not lead to a
false prediction of the model. The presented paper
provides a conceptual introduction to adversarial
training as well as a review of current methods.
While it is not possible to discuss all adversarial
training approaches, some recent advancements
are described in detail and their advantages and
disadvantages are highlighted. Additionally, pos-
sible directions for future research are presented.
