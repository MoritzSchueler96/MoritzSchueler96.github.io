We compare different graph neural networks for the task of deep metric learning on the datasets CUB-200-2011, Cars196,
Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes. Special focus is on different realizations of the attention mechanism.
Furthermore, we try to enhance the graph construction by only connecting nodes with similar embeddings.
Deep metric learning tries to solve the task of attributing a similarity score between different data samples. In
particular, it tries to find a lower dimensional mapping where the distance between data points depicts their
similarity.
